        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 whole eggs</li>
                    <li>Bacon</li>
                    <li>Tbps of butter</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Alright ya bum, the first step is to fry the bacon in a pan over medium high heat until crispy. Flipping regularly and when needed. Put aside on a plate and paper towels to drain the excess oil.</li>
                <li>Use the same pan with the existing bacon grease to fry the eggs. Place over medium heat and crack both your eggs.</li>
                <li>Cook the eggs anyway you like them. For sunny side up - leave the eggs to fry on one side and cover the pan with a lid to allow the yolks to steam and cook. For over-easy eggs- flip the eggs over after a few minutes and cook for another minute.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
