            <h2>Italian Style Sausage Risotto</h4>
                <p>This recipe is a very basic sausage risotto. This dish is very labour intensive, so be ready to be cooking non-stop for the next hour or so! The ingredients list is just for reference, so feel free to substitute the type of sausage or the broth! </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 mild Italian sausage link</li>
                        <li>4 tablespoons diced shallots</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
                        <li>1 cup Arborio rice</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup any cooking white wine</li>
                        <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
                        <li>3 sprigs fresh parsley, or to taste</li>
                    </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a saute pan over medium heat. Add sausage and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, for 3 minutes. Add shallots, 1 tablespoon butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt; saute until shallots begin to caramelize, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
                        <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat. Add Arborio rice and stir until it begins to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add wine and continue stirring until almost absorbed, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Begin to add broth, 1/2 cup at a time. Stir until broth is almost completely absorbed, then add another 1/2 cup and repeat. Continue adding broth until risotto resembles a thick porridge but still has some bite to it. This process will take 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Remove from the heat. Stir in the sausage mixture, Parmesan cheese, and remaining 1 tablespoon butter. Season with salt if necessary. Garnish with parsley sprigs, serve and enjoy!</li>
