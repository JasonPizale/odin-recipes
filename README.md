Odin Project assignment

This project is to test the HTML abilities I have so far learned in the Odin Project, and to apply them to a website.
The goal of the projext is to create a basic recipe website using HTML.

NOTE: the projext will not be using CSS styling until a later period, for now the only concern is HTML. Thus the website will not look visually appealing.
